			description: "So glad I discovered this gym. This location was the D'Luis gym from years ago. Great location, first of all. The machines here are fantastic and in great condition. And the people here are very respectful and come to work out, not sit on their phones or to be looked at/look pretty. 600p monthly fee, 50p day pass. There are also supplements available to put in your water or to take as well as for sale. They'll be getting my business. Recommended.",
